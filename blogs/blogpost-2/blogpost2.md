# Blog Post 2: The Framework App

### Important:
I did not get as far as I wanted to on this project. That's on me. What I was able to accomplish is detailed bleow.

## The basics: 11ty and Tailwind (from the perspective of a HTML/CSS purist)
For this project, I aimed to put together a proof of concept website with 11ty (a static website generator) and Tailwind (a CSS framework). My goal was to make something to familiarize myself with both, and make something I can build upon in the future.

## 11ty
I created a basic empty project and installed Tailwind and 11ty using the recommended guides. This got me a basic webpage, run using 11ty's serve function- very convenient, as I can see the site change in realtime.

## Adding Tailwind
This was a bit more challenging- Tailwind didn't want to play nice with my project directory.
